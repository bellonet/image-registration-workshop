## What is Image Registration?

- Spatial alignment of two or more images:

{{< notes >}}
Image registration is the process of transforming different sets of data into one coordinate system.
{{</ notes >}}

- Essential for comparing or integrating data

## Applications in Various Fields

{{< notes >}}
Image registration is widely used across multiple disciplines.
{{</ notes >}}

- **Microscopy**: Aligning images from different slices, channels, tiles, modalities, runs, or time points
- **Medical Imaging**: Viewpoints, stacks, normalization to an atlas, co-registering images from different modalities (e.g., MRI, CT)
- **Material Science**: Comparing material properties under varying conditions
- **Earth Science**: Aligning satellite images for change detection, georeferencing, integration from different sensors

## Fundamental Techniques - Detection & Transformation

{{< notes >}}
 An overview of common methods used in image registration, highlighting the two main steps involved.
{{</ notes >}}

Many classic image registration methods involve **two main steps**:
1. **Detecting similarities**: identifying corresponding regions or features 
   - **Feature-Based Registration**
   - **Segmentation-Based Registration**
   - **model Fitting**
   - **Graph-Based Methods**
2. **Estimating and applying transformations**: Finding and applying the optimal transformation
   - **Rigid: translation, rotation**
   - **Affine: + scaling, shearing**
   - **Perspective: + foreshortening**
   - **Non-Rigid: local deformation to accommodate changes in shape**

{{< notes >}}
The transformation matrix can also be used to warp other channels or annotation data such as segmentation.

## Example Pipeline: Feature-Based Registration

{{< notes >}}
An example of applying a feature-based registration pipeline to align two microscopy images from different modalities.
{{</ notes >}}

1. **Detecting Similarities**: identifying corresponding features
   - **Feature Detection and Matching**
     - Detect keypoints (e.g., SIFT, SURF)
     - Match features between images

2. **Estimating and Applying Transformations**: aligning the images
   - **Affine Transformation**
     - Apply translation, rotation, scaling, shearing
   - **Non-Rigid Transformation (TPS)**
     - Use Thin Plate Spline for local deformations

## Integrated Techniques: One-Step Registration

{{< notes >}}
Introducing registration methods that integrate detection and transformation into a single process.
{{</ notes >}}

- **Intensity-Based Registration**
  - Iterative - Optimize pixel intensity similarities directly to align images
- **Mutual Information-Based Registration**
  - Iterative - Use statistical dependence to align multimodal images
- **Frequency Domain Methods**
  - Compute transformations using Fourier transforms in the frequency domain.
- **Deep Learning-Based Registration**
  - Neural networks predict transformations directly from image data

---

## Challenges & Considerations

{{< notes >}}
Key challenges and preprocessing steps for effective image registration.
{{</ notes >}}

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Denoising, intensity correction, rescaling

- **Performance vs. Complexity**:
  - Trade-off between accuracy and speed

- **Transformation Type**:
  - Fit transformation to deformation (e.g., rigid vs. non-rigid)

- **Method Selection**:
  - Match image type (e.g., multimodal) to appropriate method
